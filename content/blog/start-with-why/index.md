description: Introduces myself and examines my motivation behind this new blog.

There's a tradition of starting new things at the beginning of a year. However,
the motivation behind this blog is much deeper than that and feels like a
culmination and supersession of the last 29 years of my life.

This particular moment feels like I have received the final kick up the
logarithmically shaped stairs of consciousness. My youth was long and flat and
entailed assimilation to conventional reality. My young adulthood added some
height to the stairs and activated my mind and ambition. At 27, the stairs
became shorter and clearer to perceive. I began practicing Vipassana meditation
and therapy at this time and still do to this day. At 28, I made investments
into the multiplicity of forms. I purchased a home, invested in bitcoin, and
entertained long term commitment with my girlfriend.

At this peak moment of being so completely full of the world, my worldview inverted
through an act of grace. The self-centeredness and busyness became information
about the truth of reality as direct self knowledge, perceived with my
heart. I began letting go of what I thought life was about and who I was
expected to be. Simultaneously, I was experiencing the timeless and the
formless through meditative inquiry more meaningfully. It had been three years
of daily practice at this point.

With these realizations, I entered a phase of burning away all of the forms that
didn't support my health or hinder my connection to the ground within. Leaving
me with a blank canvas where I can continue to explore subtle pings of
intuition. This was the most recent kick up the stairs of consciousness that
aligns archetypally with my Saturn return.

Lastly, I'm looking to come out of hiding from my hermitage in the woods.
Accumulating self knowledge is only so beneficial. This is why I begin this
blog-- to articulate what I'm experiencing for both my own sake and so that others
might find their own path through hearing my experiences. More specifically
though, I will write about spirituality, meditation, astrology, mysticism, and
whatever moments or dreams I feel the need to share.
