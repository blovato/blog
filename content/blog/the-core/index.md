description: A poem about the human experience.
---

<pre>
Acorn accord
Third world
Born to mourn
Stuck with thorn
Roots in the core
From shore to shore

Freedom traded for escape
From human to ape,
Stuck in habit—
We all have it.

See the system
Don’t speak; listen
The unfolding now,
It’s coded, Tao

Become an earthling and unearth things,
To see what wisdom brings.
Observe it all—
The falling leaves,
A whispered call.

No more fables,
We’re strong and able.
Forage the heart,
Then decline and depart.
A chance to live behind the veil,
It’s real as fuck, we will prevail.
</pre>
